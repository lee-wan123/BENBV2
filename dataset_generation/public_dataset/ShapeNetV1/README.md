# Usage

0. Unzip the `ShapeNetCore.v1.zip` file, referred to as *ShapeNetV1*, from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ShapeNet/ShapeNetCore-archive). The structure of the current folder should look like:

    ```sh
    │   02691156.zip
    │   02747177.zip
    │   02773838.zip
    ...
    │   generate_data.py
    │   generate_split_list.py
    │   README.md
    │   taxonomy.json # it comes from ShapeNetV1
    ```

1. To create a list file consisting of the paths for target files for training, evaluating, and testing, run:

    ```sh
    python generate_split_list.py
    ```

2. Based on the list files (e.g., `train_set.txt`, `eval_set.txt`, and `test_set.txt`) generated by the previous script, you can create the specific files into folders by running:

    ```sh
    python generate_data.py
    ```

    Now, you have the following structure:

    ```sh
    │   02691156.zip
    │   02747177.zip
    │   02773838.zip
    ...
    │   generate_data.py
    │   generate_split_list.py
    │   README.md
    │   taxonomy.json
    │   train_set.txt
    │   eval_set.txt
    │   test_set.txt
    │   train
    │   eval
    │   test
    ```

    where `train`, `eval`, and `test` are the folders containing the target files for training, evaluating, and testing, respectively.
